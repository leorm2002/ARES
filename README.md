# ARES: Agent-Based Realistic Environment Simulation

ARES is an Agent-Based Model (ABM) simulation engine developed as a project for the Object-Oriented Programming course at the University of Bologna.


## Project Summary

ARES is a versatile simulation engine designed to run various Agent-Based Models. It features:

- A core simulation engine
- Multiple pre-implemented models including Boids, Schelling's Segregation, Predator-Prey, Virus Diffusion, Sugarscape and Fire Spread
- Both GUI and CLI interfaces for running simulations
- Ability to save and load simulations or export simulation parameters
- Extensible architecture for adding new models
